# Camera_Examples    
Software examples for Thorlabs' imaging products (e.g. Scientific Cameras)

## Repo Organization
All examples are split up by programming language and product type. Directions on using specific examples are given within the folders.

## Requirements

All examples are built using the libraries provided with ThorCam software package, which can be found [here](https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=ThorCam). DLLs are not provided by this repository in order to save space and ensure that the latest or most appropriate versions of the DLLs are used with your application.

Thorlabs also provides Linux shared libraries on the ThorCam installation page. Examples showing the use of these will be added in the future. 

### C\# and C++ Soft Requirements

Guides written for these examples are written with Microsoft's Visual Studio in mind, which can be downloaded [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
Other IDEs can be used, but instructions are not provided in this repository.
